Discord Bots for BUChess Discord Server

There are three bots for the BUChess Discord Server. They are managed by me, Alan.

The Lagno bot will provide the rules as well as encouraging messages to members. The Hikaru bot will provide quotes to members. The Carlsen bot will provide chess API and rules list to members.
